# eye
## This is a useful link on how to build some mouse cursor moving, and make it simply running through your screen.
This is supposed to show some eyes and how the mouse cursor interaction works.
If you want to find further information about it, or discuss some issues, feel free to contact me. My information can be found under: https://lvoliveira1.gihub.com
## Future Improvements
You could start workig on styling the eyes, by adding different colors using the style sheet. Also you could try to create a face and add a mouth, that the tong could actually seek for the mouse too.
## How to run
To run the functions, you simply need to drag the html to a browser and keep playing with your mouse through your screen.
